            <h1 class="big-title">When your pet is stressed out, what should you do?</h1>
            <p class="padding-p-relax"> Many people still believe that the difference between humans and pets is largely
              due
              to emotions. They think
              that pets like dogs and cats have no feelings, but in fact, this is completely wrong. As everyone knows,
              dogs
              are pets that have been domesticated by humans for a long time, they have lived with humans for a long
              time,
              so
              they always tend to want to be closer to their owners. They have feelings, they also know how to
              distinguish
              between friends and enemies and of course they can also be "Shocked" when they encounter something. Such
              “shocks” can cause long-lasting depression that is difficult to treat</p>

            </div>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Pets are often very sensitive to the change of the living environment, such as
              when
              they move to a new home or
              when the house appears a new member. At times like this, our pet will often have some shock signs, often
              they
              will become uncomfortable or bite and sad. There are even some cases, pets may vomit, skin rash, diarrhea,
              stop
              eating or appetite.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Added or lost a family member: The most common case is that the owner no longer spends much time with
                them
                due to being too busy. According to statistics in the UK, an average of 1 in 4 pets suffers from
                psychological
                problems because the owner often goes to work and does not spend much time with them. In addition, when
                the
                owner's mood is too stressed or stressed, their pets is also affected.</li>
              <li> When there is a new member in their family: This is also considered one of the most common causes of
                depression in pets. </li>
              <li> Moving to a new place.</li>
              <li>Age-related depression: As your pets gets older, your pets may experience some decline in functional
                functions such as eating, limping, blurred vision, etc. Because these are important activities that
                affect
                quality. Life, so our pets is very susceptible to depression because it can no longer maintain the same
                rhythm
                of life as before.</li>
              <li>Weather-related depression: If you live in areas with extreme weather conditions, your pets is more
                likely
                to become depressed if the weather changes for the worse. </li>

                <li>Reduce physical activity: Our pets no longer runs around or plays like usual, instead they just curl
                  up
                  and sleep all day.
                </li>
                <li>Eating less or even not eating, this can lead to changes in weight and sometimes it will affect
                  their
                  health.
                </li>
                <li>Depression can make your pets change his personality, they become lethargic, aggressive and
                  sometimes
                  even
                  pee in the house.
                </li>
                <li>Sleep changes: Their abnormal sleep rhythm is also an easy sign to recognize, when stressed they
                  often
                  prefer to sleep during the day and wake up at night.

                    psychological illness, for example, a sad pet that no longer likes to run and jump can also be

              <h3 class="small-title">6 Proven Ways to Calm Your Anxious pets</h3>
              <h5>1. Exercise Your Pets</h5>
              <div class="padding-p-relax">
                <p>If your pets has separation anxiety, the obvious way to ease their mind is to never leave them alone.
                  That is
                  not a reality for most pet owners, so using exercise as both a bonding time and to tire out your pet
                  is
                  often
                  an easy fix!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because anxiety can cause an excess of energy, taking your pets out to play ball or on a long walk
                  before
                  you
                  leave can be helpful. Providing plenty of physical contacts and talking to them during this time is
                  also
                  beneficial. And, like their human counterparts, exercise can help relieve stress by producing
                  beneficial
                  endorphins.</p>
              </div>
              <h5 class="small-title">2. Physical Contact</h5>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">There is probably nothing more soothing to anxious pets than their owner’s
                touch.
                Try to identify the signs
                of anxiety in your pets and nip them in the bud as early as possible by picking them up, cuddling on the
                couch, or giving them a good long petting session.</p>
              <h5 class="small-title">3. Massage</h5>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">As you probably know, a massage will relax and calm even the most anxious human
                —
                did you know it also works
                wonders with pets as well?! Anxiety often causes tensing of the muscles and massage therapy is one way
                to
                alleviate tension. Start at the neck and work downward with long strokes. Try to keep one hand on the
                pets,
                while the other works to massage. Over time you may even be able to identify where your pets hold their
                stress
                and just work on that one particular area.
              </p>
              <h5 class="small-title">4. Music Therapy</h5>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">Music therapy has been proven to be beneficial for both humans, as well as our
                canine and feline friends. The
                power of music can be calming and relaxing while you’re home, in the car, or away from your pet. Music
                can
                also alleviate noise sensitivity by blocking the street or scary noises that bothersome pets and create
                anxiety.</p>
              <p>Research has shown that many pets prefer classical music. Harp music, often used in hospice situations,
                can
                be a natural sedative. You might try:

              </ul>
              <h5 class="small-title">5. Time-Out</h5>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">While anxiety isn’t a bad behavior per se, it can help to give your pets some
                time-out when they’re acting
                out. Isolating your pet in a safe and quiet space can help calm their frayed nerves. Maybe that space
                has
                some
                very quiet music playing, low lights, and/or some aromatherapy available</p>
              <h5 class="small-title">6. Alternative Therapies</h5>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">
                While there is limited evidence that alternative products can be of benefit to dogs suffering from
                anxiety,
                the products listed below are non-invasive and will cause no harm. They are therapies that can be used
                alone
                or combined with those above to be more effective. Be sure to do proper research before implementing
                alternative therapies, and consult with your veterinarian, too.</p>
              <h6 class="small-title">Rescue Remedy for Pets</h6>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">Rescue Remedy is part of the Bach homeopathic line of remedies for humans.
                Homeopathy was founded over 200
                years ago and is popular in Europe and England. (The Queen even has her own Royal Homepath.) It is based
                on
                the principle of similarity and uses plants and flower in all remedies.</p>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">Rescue Remedy Pet is comprised of 5 different Bach Flower Remedies that
                constitute
                a stress reliever. It is
                completely safe to use on your dog. You just add 2-4 drops directly to their drinking water. There is
                also
                a
                spray that you can use on pet bedding and toys.</p>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">Note: There are other homeopathic remedies that can be used on pets for
                specific
                issues, like constant
                barking, intolerance toward strangers, or loss of an owner.</p>
              <h6 class="small-title"> Supplements</h6>
              <p class="padding-p-relax">There are dog treats that contain helpful supplements proven to help anxiety.
                Typically they will contain
                melatonin, thiamin, chamomile, L-Theanine or L-tryptophan. Some also have a ginger element to help with
                sensitive stomachs. These are often recommended for general and travel anxiety.</p>
