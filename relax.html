          <h1>When your pet is stressed out, what should you do?</h1>
          <p class="padding-p-relax"> Many people still believe that the difference between humans and pets is largely
            due
            to emotions. They think
            that pets like dogs and cats have no feelings, but in fact, this is completely wrong. As everyone knows,
            dogs
            are pets that have been domesticated by humans for a long time, they have lived with humans for a long time,
            so
            they always tend to want to be closer to their owners. They have feelings, they also know how to distinguish
            between friends and enemies and of course they can also be "Shocked" when they encounter something. Such
            “shocks” can cause long-lasting depression that is difficult to treat</p>

          </div>
          <p class="padding-p-relax">Pets are often very sensitive to the change of the living environment, such as when
            they move to a new home or
            when the house appears a new member. At times like this, our pet will often have some shock signs, often
            they
            will become uncomfortable or bite and sad. There are even some cases, pets may vomit, skin rash, diarrhea,
            stop
            eating or appetite.</p>

          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Added or lost a family member: The most common case is that the owner no longer spends much time with
              them
              due to being too busy. According to statistics in the UK, an average of 1 in 4 pets suffers from
              psychological
              problems because the owner often goes to work and does not spend much time with them. In addition, when
              the
              owner's mood is too stressed or stressed, their pets is also affected.</li>
            <li> When there is a new member in their family: This is also considered one of the most common causes of
              depression in pets. </li>
            <li> Moving to a new place.</li>
            <li>Age-related depression: As your pets gets older, your pets may experience some decline in functional
              functions such as eating, limping, blurred vision, etc. Because these are important activities that affect
              quality. Life, so our pets is very susceptible to depression because it can no longer maintain the same
              rhythm
              of life as before.</li>
            <li>Weather-related depression: If you live in areas with extreme weather conditions, your pets is more
              likely
              to become depressed if the weather changes for the worse. </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Reduce physical activity: Our pets no longer runs around or plays like usual, instead they just curl
                up
                and sleep all day.
              </li>
              <li>Eating less or even not eating, this can lead to changes in weight and sometimes it will affect their
                health.
              </li>
              <li>Depression can make your pets change his personality, they become lethargic, aggressive and sometimes
                even
                pee in the house.
              </li>
              <li>Sleep changes: Their abnormal sleep rhythm is also an easy sign to recognize, when stressed they often
                prefer to sleep during the day and wake up at night.
              </li>

                <strong>Note:</strong>
                <em> It is important to clearly distinguish between symptoms that cause physical and
                  psychological illness, for example, a sad pet that no longer likes to run and jump can also be caused
                  by
                  pain from arthritis.

            <h3>6 Proven Ways to Calm Your Anxious pets</h3>
            <h5>1. Exercise Your Pets</h5>
            <div class="padding-p-relax">
              <p>If your pets has separation anxiety, the obvious way to ease their mind is to never leave them alone.
                That is
                not a reality for most pet owners, so using exercise as both a bonding time and to tire out your pet is
                often
                an easy fix!
              </p>
              <p>
                Because anxiety can cause an excess of energy, taking your pets out to play ball or on a long walk
                before
                you
                leave can be helpful. Providing plenty of physical contacts and talking to them during this time is also
                beneficial. And, like their human counterparts, exercise can help relieve stress by producing beneficial
                endorphins.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>2. Physical Contact</h5>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">There is probably nothing more soothing to anxious pets than their owner’s touch.
              Try to identify the signs
              of anxiety in your pets and nip them in the bud as early as possible by picking them up, cuddling on the
              couch, or giving them a good long petting session.</p>
            <h5>3. Massage</h5>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">As you probably know, a massage will relax and calm even the most anxious human —
              did you know it also works
              wonders with pets as well?! Anxiety often causes tensing of the muscles and massage therapy is one way to
              alleviate tension. Start at the neck and work downward with long strokes. Try to keep one hand on the
              pets,
              while the other works to massage. Over time you may even be able to identify where your pets hold their
              stress
              and just work on that one particular area.
            </p>
            <h5>4. Music Therapy</h5>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Music therapy has been proven to be beneficial for both humans, as well as our
              canine and feline friends. The
              power of music can be calming and relaxing while you’re home, in the car, or away from your pet. Music can
              also alleviate noise sensitivity by blocking the street or scary noises that bothersome pets and create
              anxiety.</p>
            <p>Research has shown that many pets prefer classical music. Harp music, often used in hospice situations,
              can
              be a natural sedative. You might try:
            </p>

              <li>Through A Dog’s Ear by pianist Lisa Spector and psychoacoustics researcher Joshua Leeds
              </li>
              <li>Noah’s Harp: Surrender by Susan Raimond</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>5. Time-Out</h5>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">While anxiety isn’t a bad behavior per se, it can help to give your pets some
              time-out when they’re acting
              out. Isolating your pet in a safe and quiet space can help calm their frayed nerves. Maybe that space has
              some
              very quiet music playing, low lights, and/or some aromatherapy available</p>
            <h5>6. Alternative Therapies</h5>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">
              While there is limited evidence that alternative products can be of benefit to dogs suffering from
              anxiety,
              the products listed below are non-invasive and will cause no harm. They are therapies that can be used
              alone
              or combined with those above to be more effective. Be sure to do proper research before implementing
              alternative therapies, and consult with your veterinarian, too.</p>
            <h6>Rescue Remedy for Pets</h6>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Rescue Remedy is part of the Bach homeopathic line of remedies for humans.
              Homeopathy was founded over 200
              years ago and is popular in Europe and England. (The Queen even has her own Royal Homepath.) It is based
              on
              the principle of similarity and uses plants and flower in all remedies.</p>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Rescue Remedy Pet is comprised of 5 different Bach Flower Remedies that
              constitute
              a stress reliever. It is
              completely safe to use on your dog. You just add 2-4 drops directly to their drinking water. There is also
              a
              spray that you can use on pet bedding and toys.</p>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Note: There are other homeopathic remedies that can be used on pets for specific
              issues, like constant
              barking, intolerance toward strangers, or loss of an owner.</p>
            <h6>Supplements</h6>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">There are dog treats that contain helpful supplements proven to help anxiety.
              Typically they will contain
              melatonin, thiamin, chamomile, L-Theanine or L-tryptophan. Some also have a ginger element to help with
              sensitive stomachs. These are often recommended for general and travel anxiety.</p>
