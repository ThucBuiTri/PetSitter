        <h3>Things to prepare to trim your dog's hair at home</h3>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Before trimming the dog's hair, we should prepare all the items to facilitate the process. The tools you need
          are:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Trimmer:
        </h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Trimmers can help you clean up areas of dense hair that scissors can't. With super fast cutting speed and
          absolute safety, </br>the trimmer will be the right choice for pets in the hot summer.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">There are two types of trimmer on the market today: corded and cordless. In
          particular, the wireless type is
          rated as safer for pets.</br> It is suitable for beginners to trim dog hair because of its compact, non-entangled
          design. During the trimming process, it is also easy to change </br>the shaving direction without having to adjust
          the wire like a corded trimmer.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Comb</h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">You need to comb and detangle the dog's coat before trimming the dog's coat. That's why combs are a must-have
          in your home. </br>There are many types of combs on the market today. Depending on your dog's coat type, there are
          appropriate options.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Drag</h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Do not think that just a normal pair of scissors bought at the market is enough to trim the dog's hair. Dog
          hair is many times thicker</br> and denser than human hair. Each type of scissors in the set will have its own
          function. They are used to take care of different parts of the dog's body.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">The dog grooming scissors set usually includes the following 3 types:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Straight scissors: used to cut basic hair lines.
          </li>
          <li>Curved scissors: to round the coat, making </br>the coat look more natural and soft. For example,</br> if you want
            to cut and round a puppy's face, you must</br> definitely use curved scissors to get the best shape.
          </li>
          <li>Serrated scissors: used to thin thick areas of hair.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The process of trimming dog hair at home properly</h3>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Once you're ready, let's start trimming your baby's hair.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Step 1: Clean hair clippers</h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">The hair clippers are rarely used, but the bacteria on them are not few. You need to wash them before using.
        </br> Cleaning your dog's hair clipper not only ensures the beauty of its coat, but also ensures its safety. </br>If you
          accidentally scratch or tear your dog's skin, the risk of bacterial invasion will be significantly reduced.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Step 2: Brush your dog's coat</h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Before proceeding with trimming, you need to thoroughly comb all parts of the dog's body to remove loose
          hair.</br> At the same time, untangle the sticky hairs so that the trimming process goes smoothly. Brushing before
          trimming will help you </br> determine which areas are uneven and the length of hair you need to cut.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Brushing the dog's coat should be in the direction of hair growth. That is, from
          the head down to the tail, </br>
          from the shoulder blades down to the feet. Absolutely do not brush backwards, which can cause further tangles.</br>
          You just brush until the coat is smooth, during the dog's molting period, you should brush about 4-6 times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Step 3: Fix your dog</h4>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">While trimming the dog's coat, she kept running around. It's dangerous and frustrating, isn't it? To ensure
          safety and save time, </br>it is best to use a fixed collar or ask someone to hold it tight during the grooming
          process.</p>
          <div class="img-center">
            <img style="width: 700px;" src="img/2-cut-hair.jpg" alt="">
          </div>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Step 4: Trim the important part first</h3>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">The later the puppy gets impatient. She may bark more, wiggle more. So, trim the hair in sensitive areas
          first. That is, hard to do first,</br> easy to do later. The sequence of hair trimming for pet dogs is as follows:</br>
          head - armpits - under tail - sides of groin - buttocks - nape - sides of body - abdomen.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Some girls and boys are afraid of the noise of the trimmer. So, before trimming your dog's hair, </br>start the
          trimmer a few dozen seconds in advance to let him get used to it.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax">Trim in long, slow strokes instead of fast and intermittent strokes. Not every dog ​​needs a haircut.</br> Because
          fur has the role of keeping warm or preventing sunburn.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-relax"> Above is the process of trimming dog hair at home. Wishing you success. If you find it really difficult to trim
        at home,</br> you can visit Petkingdom for short instruction classes to help you gain more knowledge to take better
