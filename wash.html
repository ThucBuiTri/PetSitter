        <h4> Step 1: Preparation stage</h4>
        <p>
            Brush the dog a few times before starting the bath. Make sure there aren't any tangled hairs left. The hairs
            that are too tangled can be removed by hand or if you want to quickly, they can be cut. You should brush
            about 2-3 times to remove as much hair loss as possible.
            Then, put a few drops of eye drops and then insert cotton balls in your ears to protect those two rather
            sensitive parts from shower gel. If your dog's toenails are too long, you should trim them neatly before
            bathing. To avoid them struggling hard and scratching your hands while bathing.
        </p>
        <h4> Step 2: Wet the dog's coat</h4>
        <P> Wet your baby's hair from head to toe. Remember to check the water temperature with your hand before pouring
            it on him. If possible, use a hand-held sprayer with moderate water pressure. Otherwise, use a faucet or a
            ladle. But by doing so, the wetting process will take longer. Be careful not to spray water directly into
            the dog's eyes or ears.
            Some dogs like: Alaska, Samoyed, Husky, or Corgi all have a waterproof coat that is difficult to get wet.
            You should use a comb to brush against the direction of hair growth to expose the undercoat. Then rinse with
            water to make wetting easier.
        </P>
        <h4>Step 3: Pour shower gel</h4>
        <p>
            Pour shower gel on the dog's coat. Avoid sensitive areas such as eyes, ears, nose, mouth and genitals. Then
            apply the shower gel slowly until it foams just enough. If it is a thick shower gel, we should dilute it
            with water before using it.

        <h4>Step 4: Scrub and massage</h4>
        <p>
            Scrub and massage your dog for a few minutes. Scrub the dirty hairs thoroughly. It is best to let the shower
            gel stay on the hair for 10-15 minutes before rinsing, it will be cleaner. Especially when using medicated
            shower gels.
            You can scrub it by hand like washing your hair. Or use a specialized pet brush to help create better foam.
            Your baby also feels more satisfied when they are massaged in this way.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5: Rinse the shower gel with water</h4>
        <p>Rinse a small amount of water on the bristles to remove the foam. Rinse thoroughly to push shower gel out of
            hair. A spray with high water pressure will clean the foam faster than flushing with a mug, cup or bucket.
            Remember to clean the shower gel in the nooks and crannies of the dog's body. Such as: between toes, between
            ears, underarms and genitals.</p>
        <h4>Step 6: Dry the coat</h4>
        <p>After bathing, stop for a moment to let the dog shake to help reduce the amount of water on the coat. Then,
            take a towel to dry it to absorb all the excess water on the fur. Usually, it takes 2-3 towels to absorb all
            the water for dogs with thick coats. Like Poodle Standard or Alaska.
            To dry your dog's hair quickly and completely, you can use a specialized pet dryer. Be sure to use the dryer
            with medium heat + low heat to avoid panicking your dog. Never point the dryer directly at their face, eyes
            or ears. When the dog's coat is completely dry, proceed to combing the coat to shape the coat and make them
            smoother. Try to keep the dog upright, not lying down, and not sitting until the coat is dry.</p>
