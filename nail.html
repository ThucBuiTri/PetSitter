                <p class="padding-p-relax">When raising pet dogs, many owners are only interested in bathing and trimming, but forget that
                    regular <br> nail clipping is also a necessary job. Dog paws are like humans, they will grow continuously
                    from birth to death. </br>If you forget to trim, too long nails can make it difficult for your dog to
                    move. Not to mention, if left for a long time, </br>the nail can get into the meat and cause a serious
                    infection.</p>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">That's why, PetSitter will dedicate the following article to guide you on how to cut your dog's nails
                    at home with a very discounted </br>nail trimming kit</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Why is it important to trim the dog's nails so often?</h3>
                <div class="img-center">
                    <img src="img/cach-cat-mong-cho-cho-an-toan-khong-dau-tai-nha-202104131355538576.jpg" alt="">
                    <p class="text-center">Dogs should be trimmed regularly</p>
                </div>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">Regular dog nail clipping is not only a matter of beauty but also helps protect your dog's health.
                    Some of the reasons</br> why it is imperative that you trim your dog's nails regularly are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If left too long, the dog's toenails can break. In some cases, the ingrown nail will pierce the
                        inner flesh causing pain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Nails that are too long will make it difficult for the dog to move. Feet may be deformed, spread
                        toes, broken nails, bleeding,</br> and discomfort. Over time, the bones of the legs and hips are
                        affected making them unable to walk normally.
                    </li>
                    <li>Long toenails will interfere with the function of the foot pad. In the long term, it affects the
                        bones of the feet and ligaments of the joints.
                    </li>
                    <li>Too long and sharp dog nails can scratch your skin during bathing or trimming.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How often should a dog's nails be trimmed?
                </h3>

                <p class="padding-p-relax">Dog's toenails grow pretty quickly, so it's usually a good idea to trim or sharpen them at least
                    every 2
                    weeks. </br>If you have a lot of free time, you can trim your dog's nails once a week. If possible, you
                    can
                    take your dog to pet spas for nail trimming.</br> This will make it much cleaner and safer.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Nail clippers</h3>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">Dog nail clippers require a separate kit because dog nails are very thick and hard. You can not
                    arbitrarily cut them with </br>a pair of scissors or a knife, it will be very dangerous. If you don't
                    have a dedicated dog nail clipper, you can find them at Shop.Sieupet.com,</br> which is currently on

                </h3>
                <h4>Note the "pink area" before cutting the dog's nails
                </h4>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">The "pink zone" is an area in a dog's paw that contains many blood vessels and nerves. If you
                    accidentally cut this area, </br>it will cause pain and bleeding for the dog. Ideally, you should trim
                    your nails 2-4 mm from the pink area.</p>

                <h3>Steps to cut dog nails</h3>
                <p class="padding-p-relax">There are many different nail clippers, but there are two simple and most popular ones: square
                    (U-shaped ) and scissors.</br> If you are just starting to practice cutting, you should choose the
                    scissors cut because it is easier to work, you do not need to press </br>the surface of the pliers to the
                    nail.</p>

                <ol style="list-style: none;">
                    <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 1: Call the dog back and place him on a table level with you in the most comfortable
                        position. If the puppy shows signs of fear, you should ask someone to take care of it. Avoid
                        letting them squirm during the cutting process, it will be very easy to cut into the meat.

                    </li>
                    <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 2: You should start trimming the toenails of the hind legs first. Pick them up gently but
                        firmly. Be careful when lifting the hind legs, avoid turning the legs, which can cause injury.

                    </li>
                    <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 3: Gently push the top of the dog's paw up to expose the nail. Tilt the tip of the pliers
                        about 45 degrees and cut off the excess nail. Press the pliers gently but firmly to avoid
                        breaking the dog's nails. Be careful not to cut a blood vessel.

                    </li>
                    <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 4: After cutting, you should use a file to sharpen the nail to reduce the sharpness. Avoid
                        scratching yourself when bathing them.

                    </li>
                    <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 5: Praise your dog when the nail clipping is done well. You can reward them with snacks or
                        a favorite treat to encourage them.

                <h3>Some notes when cutting nails
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You cannot use a human nail clipper to cut a dog. It can soften the nails, causing pain or
                        injury to the dog.
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not cut nails too short. Because in everyday life, dogs still need nails to create resistance
                        and grip when moving.
                    </li>
                    <li>In order for the nail clipping to go smoothly, you should practice touching the dog's paws
                        often. Rub in between the toes, </br>gently stroke the paws so that the dog is no longer alert,
                        creating absolute trust in the owner.
                    </li>
                    <li>In case the cut accidentally touches the pink area and causes bleeding, quickly cover the
                        bleeding area (can use gauze or powder </br>to stop the bleeding for dogs) and reassure your dog.
                        After a while the bleeding will stop.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are not confident in your abilities, you should take your puppy to pet spas. The staff
                        here has experience, </br>so the nail clipping will take place quickly, gently, without fear.
                    </li>

                <h3>Harmful myths about cutting dog nails</h3>
                <h6>Dog's nails don't grow at all or grow very little?</h6>
                <p  class="padding-p-relax">The truth is that dog toenails are just like human nails. It will lengthen continuously from the time
                    they are born until they die. </br>If the claws are too long, the dog will not be able to move quickly
                    because of the pain, the ability to grip the ground will no longer be,</br> so the running speed will
                    decrease sharply. In some severe cases, long nails can get stuck in the flesh, causing pain and
                    severe infection.</p>
                <h6>Dog nails don't need to be cut but will wear off on their own?</h6>
                <p  class="padding-p-relax">Today's dogs are almost no longer able to self-abrasive like in the past. The reason may be due to
                    the narrow living space, </br>they rarely run and play, so the foundation does not have the opportunity
                    to rub with the ground to wear it off. Moreover,</br> most houses today are designed with beautiful
                    smooth brick floors. It's really a nightmare for dogs because the slippery,</br> does not help them in
                    sharpening their nails.</p>
