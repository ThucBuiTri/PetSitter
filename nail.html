            <p class="padding-p-relax">When raising pet dogs, many owners are only interested in bathing and trimming,
              but
              forget that
              regular <br> nail clipping is also a necessary job. Dog paws are like humans, they will grow continuously
              from birth to death. </br>If you forget to trim, too long nails can make it difficult for your dog to
              move. Not to mention, if left for a long time, </br>the nail can get into the meat and cause a serious
              infection.</p>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">That's why, PetSitter will dedicate the following article to guide you on how to
              cut your dog's nails
              at home with a very discounted </br>nail trimming kit</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="small-title">Why is it important to trim the dog's nails so often?</h3>
            <div class="img-center">
              <img src="img/first-img-nail.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="text-center">Dogs should be trimmed regularly</p>
            </div>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Regular dog nail clipping is not only a matter of beauty but also helps protect
              your dog's health.
              Some of the reasons</br> why it is imperative that you trim your dog's nails regularly are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If left too long, the dog's toenails can break. In some cases, the ingrown nail will pierce the
                inner flesh causing pain.
              </li>
              <li>Nails that are too long will make it difficult for the dog to move. Feet may be deformed, spread
                toes, broken nails, bleeding,</br> and discomfort. Over time, the bones of the legs and hips are
                affected making them unable to walk normally.
              </li>
              <li>Long toenails will interfere with the function of the foot pad. In the long term, it affects the
                bones of the feet and ligaments of the joints.
              </li>
              <li>Too long and sharp dog nails can scratch your skin during bathing or trimming.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="small-title">How often should a dog's nails be trimmed?
            </h3>

            <p class="padding-p-relax">Dog's toenails grow pretty quickly, so it's usually a good idea to trim or
              sharpen
              them at least
              every 2
              weeks. </br>If you have a lot of free time, you can trim your dog's nails once a week. If possible, you
              can
              take your dog to pet spas for nail trimming.</br> This will make it much cleaner and safer.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="small-title">Nail clippers</h3>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Dog nail clippers require a separate kit because dog nails are very thick and
              hard.
              You can not
              arbitrarily cut them with </br>a pair of scissors or a knife, it will be very dangerous. If you don't
              have a dedicated dog nail clipper, you can find them at Shop.PettSitter,</br> which is currently on

              ones: square
              (U-shaped ) and scissors.</br> If you are just starting to practice cutting, you should choose the
              scissors cut because it is easier to work, you do not need to press </br>the surface of the pliers to the
              nail.</p>

            <ol style="list-style: none;">
              <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 1: Call the dog back and place him on a table level with you in the
                most
                comfortable
                position. If the puppy shows signs of fear, you should ask someone to take care of it. Avoid
                letting them squirm during the cutting process, it will be very easy to cut into the meat.

              </li>
              <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 2: You should start trimming the toenails of the hind legs first. Pick
                them up gently but
                firmly. Be careful when lifting the hind legs, avoid turning the legs, which can cause injury.

              </li>
              <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 3: Gently push the top of the dog's paw up to expose the nail. Tilt the
                tip of the pliers
                about 45 degrees and cut off the excess nail. Press the pliers gently but firmly to avoid
                breaking the dog's nails. Be careful not to cut a blood vessel.

              </li>
              <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 4: After cutting, you should use a file to sharpen the nail to reduce
                the
                sharpness. Avoid
                scratching yourself when bathing them.

              </li>
              <li class="padding-step-nail">Step 5: Praise your dog when the nail clipping is done well. You can reward
                them with snacks or
                a favorite treat to encourage them.

            <h3 class="small-title">Some notes when cutting nails
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You cannot use a human nail clipper to cut a dog. It can soften the nails, causing pain or
                injury to the dog.
              </li>
              <li>Do not cut nails too short. Because in everyday life, dogs still need nails to create resistance
                and grip when moving.
              </li>
              <li>In order for the nail clipping to go smoothly, you should practice touching the dog's paws
                often. Rub in between the toes, </br>gently stroke the paws so that the dog is no longer alert,
                creating absolute trust in the owner.
              </li>
              <li>In case the cut accidentally touches the pink area and causes bleeding, quickly cover the
                bleeding area (can use gauze or powder </br>to stop the bleeding for dogs) and reassure your dog.
                After a while the bleeding will stop.
              </li>
              <li>If you are not confident in your abilities, you should take your puppy to pet spas. The staff
                here has experience, </br>so the nail clipping will take place quickly, gently, without fear.

            <h6 class="small-title">Dog's nails don't grow at all or grow very little?</h6>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">The truth is that dog toenails are just like human nails. It will lengthen
              continuously from the time
              they are born until they die. </br>If the claws are too long, the dog will not be able to move quickly
              because of the pain, the ability to grip the ground will no longer be,</br> so the running speed will
              decrease sharply. In some severe cases, long nails can get stuck in the flesh, causing pain and
              severe infection.</p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Dog nails don't need to be cut but will wear off on their own?</h6>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Today's dogs are almost no longer able to self-abrasive like in the past. The
              reason may be due to
              the narrow living space, </br>they rarely run and play, so the foundation does not have the opportunity
              to rub with the ground to wear it off. Moreover,</br> most houses today are designed with beautiful
              smooth brick floors. It's really a nightmare for dogs because the slippery,</br> does not help them in
              sharpening their nails.</p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Will nail clipping cause pain and bleeding for the dog?
            </h6>
            <p class="padding-p-relax">Dog nails are similar to human nails, so cutting them will not cause any pain.
              Except, you cut the
              blood vessels in the toenail</br> and cause bleeding. However, it doesn't pose much danger so don't worry
              too much. When you take care of your dog's nails regularly, </br>you will know where the pink area is and
              determine a reasonable nail clipping point. From there, completely limit cutting into blood vessels.
